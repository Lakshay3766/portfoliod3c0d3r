APIs are the backbone of modern systems — and secrets like API keys and refresh tokens are the crown jewels attackers seek. This post gives a short, practical guide to issuing, storing, and rotating tokens securely.

## Key Principles


## Recommended Architecture

1. Use short-lived access tokens and a trusted token issuer (STS). Long-lived refresh tokens should be stored encrypted and rotated.
2. Keep secrets out of the repo: use secrets managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) for runtime retrieval.
3. Instrument authentication flows so you can detect abnormal use (e.g., token use from unexpected geolocations).

## Rotation pattern (example)

1. Issue short-lived access tokens (minutes) and refresh tokens (hours/days) when a client authenticates.
2. On rotation, revoke the previous refresh token server-side and issue a new one.
3. If a rotation fails multiple times (indicating a stuck client), require re-authentication.

## Example: secure refresh flow (high level)

```text
Client -> Authorization Server: authenticate
Authorization Server -> Client: short-lived access token + refresh token
Client -> API: send access token
When access token expires:
  Client -> Authorization Server: present refresh token
  Authorization Server: validate, revoke old refresh token, issue new tokens
```

## Practical checklist


Following these practices reduces blast radius when a secret leaks and increases the organization's ability to recover quickly.

title: Quantum-Safe Authentication for APIs

summary: Why quantum-safe authentication matters for APIs and how to prepare for the post-quantum era.

As quantum computers become more practical, traditional cryptography faces new risks. API authentication must evolve to resist quantum attacks and ensure long-term security.

**What is quantum-safe authentication?**
- It uses algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers, such as lattice-based, hash-based, or code-based cryptography.
- It avoids reliance on RSA and ECC, which are vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm.

**How to prepare:**
1. Audit your API endpoints for use of RSA/ECC-based authentication and encryption.
2. Start testing post-quantum algorithms (NIST finalists: Kyber, Dilithium, etc.) in non-production environments.
3. Monitor vendor libraries and cloud providers for quantum-safe support.
4. Plan for hybrid deployments: combine classical and quantum-safe algorithms during migration.

**Key Takeaway:**
The transition to quantum-safe authentication is a multi-year journey. Start now to protect sensitive APIs and data for the future.

  I am a cybersecurity practitioner focused on vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT), OSINT, digital forensics, incident response, and SOC operations.
  I work on building security automation—especially phishing detection and PII leak prevention—and contribute to investigations with actionable reporting and tooling.

  I enjoy learning and shipping practical tools. Recent work spans SIEM monitoring, malware analysis, defensive automation, and hands-on forensics.

  I’m open to collaboration on security engineering, threat intelligence, and OSINT projects.

  I am a Cybersecurity student and practitioner currently working with Cyber Cell. My focus areas are penetration testing, threat hunting, digital forensics, incident response, and SOC operations. I build automation tools for phishing detection and PII leak prevention, and contribute to OSINT investigations used in real cyber cell cases. Currently, I am focused on building data pipelines and automating workflows in previous engagements.

  This is what I am doing right now: building automation and tooling for investigations and defensive operations, and improving observability in SOC workflows.

  I am always looking to learn new things. I am currently working on projects related to cybersecurity tooling, OSINT, and defensive automation. I am actively looking for remote internships in cybersecurity or data-related roles.

  I am a strong advocate for open source and I am always interested in collaborating on new projects. Feel free to reach out via email or other channels if you'd like to connect.

  Here you can see what I use on a daily basis (see the Uses page for details).

  About this site:

  Welcome — this site is my cybersecurity portfolio and blog where I publish research, tooling, and write-ups on OSINT, threat intelligence, incident response, and defensive automation. Opinions are my own.

  The site started from a Next.js + Tailwind starter template and was adapted using several helpful community resources:
  - Timothy's Next.js + Tailwind CSS template (starter)
  - Einar Guðjónsson (Now page, navigation style, animations)
